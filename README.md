# Dijkstra
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.

I have Implemented a O(n^2) Version of the Algorythmus in Python

The nodes are made and a graph gets painted then the connections between the nodes are astablished. After that Dijkstra goes over it and prints the shortest path to all nodes in the graph.
